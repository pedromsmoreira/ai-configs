# AI Agent Configurations

This directory contains specialized AI agent configurations for this project's development team. Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities to help build the application efficiently.

## Agent Skills

Task-focused, [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification)-compliant instructions live in **`.cursor/skills/`**. They **complement** (do not replace) the agents here. Skills: `go-backend`, `database-migrations`, `testing`, `frontend-react`, `user-stories`. See `.cursor/skills/README.md`. Validate with `make validate-skills` when [skills-ref](https://agentskills.io/specification) is installed.

✅ "@fe-engineer Create a user profile page with Material-UI that displays user information and allows editing"
```

### 2. Use the Right Agent
```
❌ "@fe-engineer Write a database migration"
✅ "@be-engineer Create a migration to add the notifications table"
```

### 3. Chain Agents for Complex Tasks
```
1. "@product-owner Define requirements for [feature area] (see project context)"
2. "@be-engineer Implement the [feature] backend service"
3. "@fe-engineer Create the UI to configure [feature]"
4. "@devops-engineer Add [feature] to deployment pipeline"
```

### 4. Reference Context
```
"@be-engineer Looking at USER_STORY_005.md, implement the [feature] API"
```

### 5. Ask for Reviews
```
"@product-owner Review the implementation of USER_STORY_010 against acceptance criteria"
```

## Common Questions

### Can I mix agents in one prompt?
Yes! For complex tasks, you can reference multiple agents:
```
"@product-owner and @be-engineer: Plan and implement a new [feature area] (see project context)"
```

### Which agent should I use for testing?
- Backend tests: `@be-engineer`
- Frontend tests: `@fe-engineer`
- Test planning and acceptance: `@product-owner`
- CI/CD test automation: `@devops-engineer`

### What if I'm not sure which agent to use?
Start with the **Product Owner** to clarify requirements, then they can guide you to the appropriate technical agent.

### Can agents work together?
Absolutely! Agents are designed to collaborate. The Product Owner can hand off to technical agents, and BE/FE engineers can coordinate on API contracts.

## Project-Specific Context

All agents have access to:
- Project architecture documentation (`.cursor/rules/`)
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing guidelines
- Authentication patterns
- Database patterns

They also respect:
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- Test-Driven Development approach
- Layered architecture
- Security-first mindset
