# Frontend React Skill

## When to use

- Creating or changing pages, components, or forms (React, TypeScript, MUI)
- Integrating with the REST API (see project context for API base URL), auth, or state (Zustand, React Query)
- Writing or adjusting frontend tests (Vitest, React Testing Library)
- Verifying build (`npm run build`) or fixing TypeScript/unused-import issues

For **testing** focus (TDD, mocks, coverage), use the `testing` skill and `.cursor/rules/frontend-testing-practices.mdc`.
