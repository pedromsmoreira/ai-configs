# User Stories Skill

## When to use

- Writing user stories (As a… I want… So that…) or acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Defining requirements, business rules, or prioritization (e.g. MoSCoW)
- Deciding where to put stories, bugs, enhancements, or handoffs in `docs/backlog/<phase>/`
- Reviewing an implementation against acceptance criteria (behavior and UX, not code)
