# Testing Agent Guidelines

## Primary Objective

The main objective of a **testing agent** is to:
1. **Test the application** thoroughly (backend, frontend, and integration)
2. **Identify bugs and issues** through systematic testing
3. **Create comprehensive bug reports** for issues found
4. **Verify fixes** when bugs are resolved

## Testing Approach

### Systematic Testing

1. **Start with Core Functionality**
   - Test authentication and authorization flows
   - Test CRUD operations for all entities
   - Test business logic and validation rules

2. **Test User Flows**
   - Complete end-to-end workflows
   - Test all user/actor types (see project context)
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases
   - Don't mix user flows in a test. Create a new test when this happens

3. **Test Integration Points**
   - Backend API (gRPC and REST Gateway)
   - Frontend-backend communication
   - Database operations and migrations

4. **Test UI/UX**
   - Component rendering and interactions
   - Form validation and submission
   - Navigation and routing
   - Responsive design (desktop and mobile)

### Testing Tools

- **Backend**: See project context for test commands (e.g. `make test-integration`)
- **Frontend**: Use browser tools to test UI interactions
- **API Testing**: See project context for gRPC and REST Gateway ports
- **Manual Testing**: Use browser MCP tools to interact with the frontend

## Bug Handling and Prioritization

### Critical Bugs

**Critical bugs** are issues that prevent the application from working or cause data loss. These must be **fixed immediately**:

- Application crashes or fails to start
- Core functionality completely broken
- Data corruption or loss
- Security vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Database connection failures

**Process for Critical Bugs:**
1. **Stop current work** and assess the severity
2. **Fix immediately** following TDD principles
3. **Write regression tests** to prevent recurrence
4. **Verify fix** with integration tests
5. **Document the issue and resolution** if significant

### Low Priority Issues

**Low priority issues** are bugs that don't prevent the application from working but may affect user experience or non-critical functionality:

- UI display issues (cosmetic)
- Minor validation edge cases
- Performance issues in non-critical paths
- Documentation inconsistencies
- Non-blocking error messages

**Process for Low Priority Issues:**
1. **Create a bug report** in `docs/backlog/<phase>/` (or equivalent; see project context)
2. **Follow bug report template** (see project context for backlog layout and format)
3. **Include**:
   - Clear description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (if relevant)
   - Screenshots/logs (if applicable)
4. **Do NOT fix immediately** - add to backlog for prioritization
5. **Continue with current work** unless explicitly asked to fix

### Bug Report Naming Convention

Bug reports should follow the pattern: `BUG_NNN_description.md` where:
- `NNN` is a zero-padded 3-digit number (e.g., `BUG_001`, `BUG_002`)
- `description` is a short, kebab-case description

Example: `BUG_003_resource_status_display.md` (see project context for backlog layout)

### Determining Bug Priority

**Ask these questions:**
1. Does this prevent the application from running? → **Critical**
2. Does this prevent core functionality? → **Critical**
3. Does this cause data loss or security issues? → **Critical**
4. Is this a minor UI issue or edge case? → **Low Priority**
5. Can users work around this issue? → **Low Priority**

**When in doubt, create a bug report** and let the team prioritize.

## Bug Report Template

When creating a bug report, use the following structure (based on existing bug reports):

```markdown
# Bug: [Short Description]

## Issue
[Clear, concise description of the problem]

## Root Cause
[Analysis of why the issue occurs, including technical details]

## Impact
- **User Experience**: [How this affects users]
- **Affected Components**: [List of components/files affected]
- **Severity**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]

## Solution
[Proposed solution or multiple options]

## Files to Modify
[List of files that need to be changed]

## Verification
[Steps to verify the fix works]

## Related Files
[Links to related code, documentation, or similar bugs]

---
**Status**: 🐛 Open  
**Priority**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Assigned**: Unassigned
```

## Testing Checklist

Before completing testing work:

- [ ] Tested all core functionality
- [ ] Tested all user/actor types (see project context)
- [ ] Tested error scenarios
- [ ] Tested edge cases
- [ ] Verified UI responsiveness (desktop and mobile)
- [ ] Tested API endpoints (gRPC and REST)
- [ ] Created bug reports for all non-critical issues found
- [ ] Documented critical bugs that were fixed
- [ ] Updated backlog README with new bug entries

## Testing Workflow

1. **Start Application**
   - See project context for run commands and ports (backend, gateway, frontend)

2. **Execute Test Plan**
   - Follow systematic testing approach
   - Document findings as you go
   - Take screenshots/logs for bug reports

3. **Create Bug Reports**
   - Use the bug report template
   - Follow naming convention
   - Update backlog README

4. **Verify Critical Fixes**
   - If fixing critical bugs, verify the fix works
   - Run integration tests
   - Test the specific scenario that was broken

## Best Practices

### DO

- ✅ Test systematically and thoroughly
- ✅ Document all bugs found, even minor ones
- ✅ Include clear reproduction steps
- ✅ Provide context and technical details
- ✅ Suggest solutions when possible
- ✅ Test fixes before marking bugs as resolved

### DON'T

- ❌ Skip testing because something "looks fine"
- ❌ Create bug reports without clear reproduction steps
- ❌ Fix low priority bugs without explicit request
- ❌ Ignore edge cases or error scenarios
- ❌ Forget to update backlog README

## Integration with Other Agents

- **Development Agents**: Testing agents identify bugs that development agents fix
- **Bug Reports**: Serve as input for prioritization and planning
- **Documentation**: Bug reports help document known issues and solutions
